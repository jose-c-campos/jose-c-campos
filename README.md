## ðŸ‘‹ Jose C Campos 

**`Software Engineer/Student`**

I am a senior at USC with a passion for creating digital solutions to new and unsolved problems. I am always actively learning 
through projects to teach myself new languages/frameworks that will help make me a better programmer.
All my projects are coded from scratch, and are designed to showcase my capabilities as an independent coder and problem solver.
I always make it a point to build a platform through which others can experience or interact with what I create.
Creating tangible products, either through a well-designed UI or detailed documentation, is how I challenge myself to frame 
my ideas in a way that non-programmers can appreciate and understand.
